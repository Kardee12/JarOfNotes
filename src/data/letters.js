    note: `Hi Simtard. Lw I didn't really know what much to write in here tbh, but I started thinking about us and realized I don't really say a lot of the things I should. We've been dating since November 2022, and somehow you've become such a normal, constant, and important part of my life.
You've seen every version of me —- stressed, tired, excited, stupid, and sped. And yet, you still support me a lot (even if what I do gets confusing heavily). You help make things feel calmer, which has been really helpful to me. I appreciate you a lot! We haven't really had much opportunity to spend time these past few months, but every time I have--everything feels lighter and more relaxed. You are one of my most favorite people! I lw do suck at writing ngl. Anyways...
I know I don't always say things perfectly, but I hope you always know this: I'm really grateful for you, I love you a ton, I'm really proud of us, and these past few years have been amazing!!

Happy Valentine's Day Simtard. I love you.
